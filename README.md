### Intro - About the project

The online game called "Guess My Number" allows users to play and aims to guess the number in the fewest attempts possible. Here's how it works:

1. Start with a score of 20. The computer selects a number between 1 and 20.
2. Make a guess about the selected number.
3. The computer compares the user's guess with the chosen number.
4. If the guess is incorrect, the user loses a point and receives feedback like "the guess is too high" or "the guess is too low."
5. If the user guesses correctly, the high score is determined by the difference between 20 and the number of attempts it took to guess correctly.

### Description of the Project

The structure of this project is created using HTML and CSS, while the functionality of the web app is implemented using vanilla JavaScript. The approach involves targeting and manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) of the web app. This method was chosen due to the minimal manipulation required on the DOM.
